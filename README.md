# Pokemon TCG Preview API

A small API built to serve preview card data for Pokemon TCG sets that haven't released in US yet. 

### Current Set  
**Sun & Moon - Cosmic Eclipse**

## API
The API is built exactly like the https://pokemontcg.io api so you should be able to re-use all of their clients to access the API
